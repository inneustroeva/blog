## How have I spent this week? 

Thank you for reading this post. I would like to tell you how I spent this week.This week has been difficult and very productive. I've been preparing for a mathematical logic test all week. For me, this is not an easy subject, so I have been solving various tasks for a long time and a lot. This week I found out that I wrote the matanalysis test very well, which I am very happy about. 

In addition, I wrote a test paper on the Spanish language and, according to my feeling, everything went fine, I hope for a good result. 

And over the weekend, I managed to take gorgeous photos on the streets of Moscow with my friend. A real spring has begun in Moscow, the sun has come out and the snow has melted. The mood is wonderful and I want to spend as much time outside as possible.üå∫‚òÄÔ∏è
