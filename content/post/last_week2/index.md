It's been a good week. First of all, I have completed the first stage of the control work. We started new topics in matanalysis and mathematical logic, I successfully completed laboratory tests on operating systems and did a lot of homework in other subjects. 📖📝

I was also a model at the final stage of the All-Russian Technology Olympiad. I had a pale blue beautiful dress in the style of Russian fairy tales👗

Over the weekend, I managed to go to the Moscow Zoo and take beautiful photos.🐼
