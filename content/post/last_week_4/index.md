This week has been quite productive. I spent an unforgettable time at home, in my hometown. I visited the cottage and went to the sauna. 

I also studied a lot, because we will have tests in May. Some couples were online, so I didn't miss any important couples. 📂✏️📝💻

We were not lucky with the weather at all. It was very cold and even snowed, there was a lot of rain, but sometimes the sun came out. ❄️⛄️🌥💦

Thank you for reading this post, subscribe to me.👍😘🤩
