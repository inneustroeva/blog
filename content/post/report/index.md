# Let's talk about the report üìã‚úèÔ∏è

Each project requires a report to summarize all the information and work. Creating reports in markdown is one of the easiest ways to save your time.

Every week we do laboratory work. Then we should prepare a report on our labs. We perform reports for laboratory work in the lightweight markup language markdown.

# What is MARKDOWN?‚ú®üòâ

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

# How do we execute the report? ‚ùì

For each laboratory work, we have a template that we need to fill in with all the necessary information.
The title page of the report contains information about the number of the lab, the topic and the author of the report. Next, we describe the purpose of the laboratory work, the task, as well as a theoretical introduction.
And then the description of the main part of the work begins. Description of the work.
We should describe the accomplishment of the work as fully and clearly as possible. To do this, we can divide the stages into several parts, insert screenshots and add a description, etc.
