## Introduction

This post is dedicated to scientific programming languages. Everyone knows, scientific programming is an important field that involves the creation and use of software for scientific modeling, data analysis and computation. Many programming languages have been created for these purposes.

## What is scientific programming?

Scientific programming is a highly oriented programming style for scientific calculations. It is distinguished from other types of programming by extreme correctness and stability of the final product, strict separation of scientific and interface parts, individuality of algorithms, and predominance of efficiency over universality.

Scientific programming is at the heart of any modern global research. All advanced technologies - from quantum computers to space programs - would not be possible without specialists in scientific programming, who are able to provide scientists with reliable and accurate tools for making discoveries.

## Specializations
 
Scientists use a variety of programming languages, the choice of which depends on the type of problem and the author's preferences. Historically, the first high-level programming language is Fortran; many well-established libraries for mathematical statistics and libraries for solving differential equations have been written in Fortran, which is relevant to economics and biology, respectively.

 A simpler syntax has Python, also suitable for programming mathematical computations. Python language is used for data processing in mathematics, physics, economics, biology, chemistry and can work with some other "scientific" languages: Fortran, C++, C#.

In turn, C# allows programming on the .NET platform, adapting a program to a common language runtime (CLR) and speeding up development in operational scientific sessions.
